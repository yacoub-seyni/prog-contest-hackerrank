Here's the 'David' explanation: To solve this problem, we break it up into sub-problems in the fashion of DP: If we want to know the highest result we can form for 10 and options [3,8] we would do it like this:

(To make this a bit easier, imagine 10 is a jar with the size of 10 and [3,8] are marbles that you want to put into that jar. You want to make the jar as full as possible.)

First we break it down for 1:

1. With a jar of size 1, can we put 3 in? no.
2. With a jar of size 1, can we put 8 in? no.

So we remember at a notepad:

Jar with size 1 has max marbles volume: 0

We repeat that until we are at 10 which is our maximum value.

2 is the same as 1, so we skip that for the sake of this examle, but for 3:

1. With a jar of size 3, can we put 3 in? Yes!
1.1 If we put 3 in, how much space do we have left? 0
1.2 How can we fill 0 space? We can't because it's 0. 

2. With a jar of size 3, can we put 8 in? No. 

Our 'notepad' looks like this now:

Jar with size 1 has max marbles volume: 0
Jar with size 2 has max marbles volume: 0
Jar with size 3 has max marbles volume: 3

Let's again, skip 4 and 5 because they are the same.

1. With a jar of size 6, can we put 3 in? Yes!
1.1. If we put 3 in, how much space do we have left? 3. 
1.2. How can we fill 3 spaces? We look at our notepad! 
1.3. 1x 3 marble + the maximum value we can form with the leftover space (which is 3) = 3+3 = 6. 

Jar with size 1 has max marbles volume: 0
Jar with size 2 has max marbles volume: 0
(...)
Jar with size 6 has max marbles volume: 6

Let's look at 10!

1. With a jar of size 10, can we put 3 in? Yes!
1.1. If we put 3 in, how much space do we have left? 7. 
1.2. How can we fill 7 spaces? We look at our notepad!
1.3. 1x 3 marble + the maximum value we can form with the leftover space 7 (which is 6) = 3+6 = 9

Remember 9

2. With a jar of size 10, can we put 8 in? Yes!
2.1. If we put 8 in, how much space do we have left? 2. 
2.2. How can we fill 2 spaces? We look at our notepad!
.2.3 1x 8 marble + the max of the leftover space 2 (which is 0) = 8+0 = 8

Is 8 bigger than the other option we have (9)? No it's not. 
We don't have any other options so let's write 9 into our notepad :)

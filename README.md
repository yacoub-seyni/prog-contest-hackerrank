These are some of the data structures and algorithmic problems I tried to solve on Hackerrank website.

# Context
I am passionate about algorithms and data structures, and enjoy participating in programming contest. During the summer 2016, I led my school's programming team in practicing for the competition using Hackerrank website. Each week, we try to solve a couple of problems on a specific domain. These are my attempts in solving the problems.

# Coming Clean
I wish I could say that all the programs uploaded here are accepted answers, but it is not the case for a few of them.
